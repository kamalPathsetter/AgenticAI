After the construction of the plant, a series of provisional tests are conducted. The performance and acceptance test are the final tests to prove that the integrated plant will deliver the guaranteed figures, i.e., of power and reliability throughout its life expectancy at specific solar insolation as specified, tendered, contracted, and supervised during execution and finally tested and certified by EPC.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Performance Guarantee (PG) test for a solar power generation project is a crucial part for the long-term success of the project. The parameter guaranteed i.e., daily average power output for a given daily global average radiation on a horizontal surface, determines the financial success during the commercial operation phase of the project. The comparison to the guarantees must be a well-defined process in which the guaranteed performance parameters of the plant are specified within the contractual boundaries and guaranteed Operating conditions. Before conducting the power plant performance test, the methodology and allowable deviations are to be defined and agreed upon by the involved parties. This is a process in which the power plant owner and service providers are to work together to agree on the contractual boundaries, guarantee operating conditions and contractual obligation.\n",
